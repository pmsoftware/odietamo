Introduction to OdiEtAmo
========================

This is the Odi et Amo project, an open source community project aimed at::

  Making (commercial) team development with Oracle Data Integrator (and related
  tools) more in line with modern development processes.

In short, getting Oracle Data Integrator (ODI) to integrate with source control, code review, build tools and better monitoring in the wild.

We grew out of an internal project at a large well-known health insurer, and have now released that code base to become fully managed by the community.

A little bit of history
-----------------------

The three original developers of the code base worked at a large and well known private medical insurance company in London. They were involved in the Data Warehousing development teams and wanted to use modern source control and review techniques with the Oracle Data Integrator (ODI) and related code base.

Unfortunately the Oracle Data Integrator (as of time of writing) does not support serialising code out to a repository. The "official" approach is to use version labels, the equivalent of putting 01, 02, 03 on the end of each code file you write. To put it sarcastically, this is a little bit behind the state of the art in distributed version control.

So we had three choices. (Four, if you include giving up and going down the pub.)

1. Keep going using manual tracking (this became quickly impractical)
2. Wait for Oracle to solve it. It is not currently on any published roadmap we can find.
3. Fix it ourselves



We choose 4. go down the pub. No, sorry. *3. Fix it ourselves.*

Surprisingly, it worked.

With late nights and weekends, a couple of people pulled together enough fixes to prove this could really work.
The company then paid for further development, and currently use it internally. In an enlightened step, they then released the code base so that the community can keep it alive.

So we now have the ability to serialise in and out from a ODI repository all code at the granular level (tables, interfaces, procedures, etc), store that in any suitable source reposistory (currently targetted at TFS).  Other features include a real-time comparison of running repositories, cryptographic "fingerprinting" of repositories and more.  Please see the manual for details.
What is the current involvement of this large insurer?
As you can probably tell from the coy references, officially absolutely nothing. No funding, no warranty, no beer and pizza. This really is a community project, licensed under an approved Open Source license and totally steered by the community. Please join the mailing list.

odietamo - so where does that come from ?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus_85

Catullus 85 is a poem by the Roman poet Catullus for his mistress Lesbia. (Yes, really. His poetry has influenced everyone from Shakespeare to Betjamin.  And he was very upset when she dumped him. So don't snigger.).

The Latin odi et amo translates to I hate her and I love her

I studied Catullus as a kid and quite liked him ("He's like 2000 years old and he swears, cool!"). But mostly I liked the ODI pun.
